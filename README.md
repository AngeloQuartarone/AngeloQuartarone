## 👋 Hi everyone, I'm Angelo Quartarone!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Pisa, with a deep focus on low-level programming. My passion lies in understanding and controlling the hardware at a fundamental level, which is why I work primarily with **C**.

🔧 My GitHub is a showcase of projects that dive deep into the intricacies of system programming, embedded development, and efficient code optimization. I’m particularly interested in areas like memory management, concurrency, and hardware interfacing, where every line of code counts.

🌱 I’m currently learning more in depth **C**, but in the future I would also like to explore languages such as **Rust** and **Zig**!

💡 I also have experience with languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Bash**, and **Java**, but my true expertise and enthusiasm are in pushing the limits of low-level code.

🚀 I’m always eager to connect with others who share a passion for system-level programming, whether it's through collaboration on open-source projects or deep technical discussions. Explore my repositories to see my work in action, and feel free to reach out!

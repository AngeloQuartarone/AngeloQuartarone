# ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, I'm Angelo Quartarone!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Pisa, with a deep focus on low-level programming. My passion lies in understanding and controlling the hardware at a fundamental level, which is why I work primarily with **C**.

ðŸ”§ My GitHub is a showcase of projects that dive deep into the intricacies of system programming, embedded development, and efficient code optimization. Iâ€™m particularly interested in areas like memory management, concurrency, and hardware interfacing, where every line of code counts.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more in depth **C**, but in the future I would also like to explore languages such as **Rust** and **Zig**!

ðŸ’¡ I also have experience with languages like **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Bash**, **Java** and **OCaml**, but my true expertise and enthusiasm are in pushing the limits of low-level code.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always eager to connect with others who share a passion for system-level programming, whether it's through collaboration on open-source projects or deep technical discussions. Explore my repositories to see my work in action, and feel free to reach out!

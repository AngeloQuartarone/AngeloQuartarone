# ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, I'm Angelo Quartarone!

ðŸŽ“ I am a Computer Science student at the University of Pisa, with a deep focus on low-level programming. My passion lies in understanding and controlling the hardware, therefore primarily programming in **C**.

ðŸ”§ My GitHub is a showcase of projects, including system programming, embedded development, and efficient code optimization. I am particularly interested in areas like memory management, concurrency, and hardware interfacing, where every line of code counts.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning other low-level languages such as **Rust** and **Zig**!

ðŸ’¡ I have also experience with **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Bash**, **Java** and **OCaml**.

ðŸš€ I am always eager to connect with others who share my passion for system-level programming, either through collaboration on open-source projects and deep technical discussions. Explore my repositories to see my work in action, and feel free to reach me out!
